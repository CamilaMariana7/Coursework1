    <h1> Art by Camila Rodrigues </h1>
    <h3> Drawings made with charcoal and pencil </h3>
    <p> I would like to present my art, I have been doing drawings since the age of 7 and
      have been learning new techniques for my realistic work. </p>

  <img src="image_6487327.jpg" alt="Oscar" width="450" height="550">
  <figcaption>This is Oscar, a friend's dog. He is extremely friendly and love cuddles. Was
  absolutely amazing to draw him because of his cute face. However, because he is a very hairy dog, this work
took approximately 2 weeks to be finished. </figcaption>

  <img src="image_6487327-2.jpg" alt="Sam" width="400" height="400">
  <figcaption>This is Sam, my uncle's dog. She is very active and loves running around, as well as going into the mud
  and playing. This drawing I decided to use colour as Sam has a very specific look and colour, so I decided to make it
the highlight of this art. This work took approximately 8 days to be done.  </figcaption>
